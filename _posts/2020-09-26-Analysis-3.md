# Amazon Fine Food Reviews Analysis


Data Source: https://www.kaggle.com/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews <br>

EDA: https://nycdatascience.com/blog/student-works/amazon-fine-foods-visualization/


The Amazon Fine Food Reviews dataset consists of reviews of fine foods from Amazon.<br>

Number of reviews: 568,454<br>
Number of users: 256,059<br>
Number of products: 74,258<br>
Timespan: Oct 1999 - Oct 2012<br>
Number of Attributes/Columns in data: 10 

Attribute Information:

1. Id
2. ProductId - unique identifier for the product
3. UserId - unqiue identifier for the user
4. ProfileName
5. HelpfulnessNumerator - number of users who found the review helpful
6. HelpfulnessDenominator - number of users who indicated whether they found the review helpful or not
7. Score - rating between 1 and 5
8. Time - timestamp for the review
9. Summary - brief summary of the review
10. Text - text of the review


#### Objective:
Given a review, determine whether the review is positive (Rating of 4 or 5) or negative (rating of 1 or 2).

<br>
[Q] How to determine if a review is positive or negative?<br>
<br> 
[Ans] We could use the Score/Rating. A rating of 4 or 5 could be cosnidered a positive review. A review of 1 or 2 could be considered negative. A review of 3 is nuetral and ignored. This is an approximate and proxy way of determining the polarity (positivity/negativity) of a review.




## Loading the data

The dataset is available in two forms
1. .csv file
2. SQLite Database

In order to load the data, We have used the SQLITE dataset as it easier to query the data and visualise the data efficiently.
<br> 

Here as we only want to get the global sentiment of the recommendations (positive or negative), we will purposefully ignore all Scores equal to 3. If the score id above 3, then the recommendation wil be set to "positive". Otherwise, it will be set to "negative".

# [1]. Reading Data


```python

# using the SQLite Table to read data.
con = sqlite3.connect('database.sqlite') 
#filtering only positive and negative reviews i.e. 
# not taking into consideration those reviews with Score=3
# SELECT * FROM Reviews WHERE Score != 3 LIMIT 500000, will give top 500000 data points
# you can change the number to any other number based on your computing power

# filtered_data = pd.read_sql_query(""" SELECT * FROM Reviews WHERE Score != 3 LIMIT 500000""", con) 
# for tsne assignment you can take 5k data points

filtered_data = pd.read_sql_query(""" SELECT * FROM Reviews WHERE Score != 3 LIMIT 5000""", con) 

# Give reviews with Score>3 a positive rating, and reviews with a score<3 a negative rating.
def partition(x):
    if x < 3:
        return 0
    return 1

#changing reviews with score less than 3 to be positive and vice-versa
actualScore = filtered_data['Score']
positiveNegative = actualScore.map(partition) 
filtered_data['Score'] = positiveNegative
print("Number of data points in our data", filtered_data.shape)
filtered_data.head(3)
```

#  Exploratory Data Analysis

## [2] Data Cleaning: Deduplication

It is observed (as shown in the table below) that the reviews data had many duplicate entries. Hence it was necessary to remove duplicates in order to get unbiased results for the analysis of the data.  Following is an example:


```python
display= pd.read_sql_query("""
SELECT *

WHERE Score != 3 AND UserId="AR5J8UI46CURR"
ORDER BY ProductID
""", con)
display.head()
```

    </tr>

As can be seen above the same user has multiple reviews of the with the same values for HelpfulnessNumerator, HelpfulnessDenominator, Score, Time, Summary and Text  and on doing analysis it was found that <br>
<br> 
ProductId=B000HDOPZG was Loacker Quadratini Vanilla Wafer Cookies, 8.82-Ounce Packages (Pack of 8)<br>
<br> 
ProductId=B000HDL1RQ was Loacker Quadratini Lemon Wafer Cookies, 8.82-Ounce Packages (Pack of 8) and so on<br>

It was inferred after analysis that reviews with same parameters other than ProductId belonged to the same product just having different flavour or quantity. Hence in order to reduce redundancy it was decided to eliminate the rows having same parameters.<br>

The method used for the same was that we first sort the data according to ProductId and then just keep the first similar product review and delelte the others. for eg. in the above just the review for ProductId=B000HDL1RQ remains. This method ensures that there is only one representative for each product and deduplication without sorting would lead to possibility of different representatives still existing for the same product.


```python
#Sorting data according to ProductId in ascending order
sorted_data=filtered_data.sort_values('ProductId', axis=0, ascending=True, inplace=False, kind='quicksort', na_position='last')
```


```python
#Deduplication of entries
final=sorted_data.drop_duplicates(subset={"UserId","ProfileName","Time","Text"}, keep='first', inplace=False)
final.shape
```




    (4986, 10)




```python
#Checking to see how much % of data still remains
(final['Id'].size*1.0)/(filtered_data['Id'].size*1.0)*100
```




    99.72



<b>Observation:-</b> It was also seen that in two rows given below the value of HelpfulnessNumerator is greater than HelpfulnessDenominator which is not practically possible hence these two rows too are removed from calcualtions


```python
display= pd.read_sql_query("""
SELECT *
FROM Reviews
WHERE Score != 3 AND Id=44737 OR Id=64422
ORDER BY ProductID
""", con)

display.head()

# [3].  Text Preprocessing.

Now that we have finished deduplication our data requires some preprocessing before we go on further with analysis and making the prediction model.

Hence in the Preprocessing phase we do the following in the order below:-

1. Begin by removing the html tags
2. Remove any punctuations or limited set of special characters like , or . or # etc.
3. Check if the word is made up of english letters and is not alpha-numeric
4. Check to see if the length of the word is greater than 2 (as it was researched that there is no adjective in 2-letters)
5. Convert the word to lowercase
6. Remove Stopwords
7. Finally Snowball Stemming the word (it was obsereved to be better than Porter Stemming)<br>

After which we collect the words used to describe positive and negative reviews


```python
# printing some random reviews
sent_0 = final['Text'].values[0]
print(sent_0)
print("="*50)

sent_1000 = final['Text'].values[1000]
print(sent_1000)
print("="*50)

sent_1500 = final['Text'].values[1500]
print(sent_1500)
print("="*50)

sent_4900 = final['Text'].values[4900]
print(sent_4900)
print("="*50)

    Why is this $[...] when the same product is available for $[...] here?<br />http://www.amazon.com/VICTOR-FLY-MAGNET-BAIT-REFILL/dp/B00004RBDY<br /><br />The Victor M380 and M502 traps are unreal, of course -- total fly genocide. Pretty stinky, but only right nearby.
    ==================================================
    I recently tried this flavor/brand and was surprised at how delicious these chips are.  The best thing was that there were a lot of "brown" chips in the bsg (my favorite), so I bought some more through amazon and shared with family and friends.  I am a little disappointed that there are not, so far, very many brown chips in these bags, but the flavor is still very good.  I like them better than the yogurt and green onion flavor because they do not seem to be as salty, and the onion flavor is better.  If you haven't eaten Kettle chips before, I recommend that you try a bag before buying bulk.  They are thicker and crunchier than Lays but just as fresh out of the bag.
    ==================================================
    Wow.  So far, two two-star reviews.  One obviously had no idea what they were ordering; the other wants crispy cookies.  Hey, I'm sorry; but these reviews do nobody any good beyond reminding us to look  before ordering.<br /><br />These are chocolate-oatmeal cookies.  If you don't like that combination, don't order this type of cookie.  I find the combo quite nice, really.  The oatmeal sort of "calms" the rich chocolate flavor and gives the cookie sort of a coconut-type consistency.  Now let's also remember that tastes differ; so, I've given my opinion.<br /><br />Then, these are soft, chewy cookies -- as advertised.  They are not "crispy" cookies, or the blurb would say "crispy," rather than "chewy."  I happen to like raw cookie dough; however, I don't see where these taste like raw cookie dough.  Both are soft, however, so is this the confusion?  And, yes, they stick together.  Soft cookies tend to do that.  They aren't individually wrapped, which would add to the cost.  Oh yeah, chocolate chip cookies tend to be somewhat sweet.<br /><br />So, if you want something hard and crisp, I suggest Nabiso's Ginger Snaps.  If you want a cookie that's soft, chewy and tastes like a combination of chocolate and oatmeal, give these a try.  I'm here to place my second order.

The best thing was that there were a lot of "brown" chips in the bsg (my favorite), so I bought some more through amazon and shared with family and friends.  I am a little disappointed that there are not, so far, very many brown chips in these bags, but the flavor is still very good.  I like them better than the yogurt and green onion flavor because they do not seem to be as salty, and the onion flavor is better.  If you haven't eaten Kettle chips before, I recommend that you try a bag before buying bulk.  They are thicker and crunchier than Lays but just as fresh out of the bag.

    Wow.  So far, two two-star reviews.  One obviously had no idea what they were ordering; the other wants crispy cookies.  Hey, I'm sorry; but these reviews do nobody any good beyond reminding us to look  before ordering.These are chocolate-oatmeal cookies.  If you don't like that combination, don't order this type of cookie.  I find the combo quite nice, really.  The oatmeal sort of "calms" the rich chocolate flavor and gives the cookie sort of a coconut-type consistency.  Now let's also remember that tastes differ; so, I've given my opinion.Then, these are soft, chewy cookies -- as advertised.  They are not "crispy" cookies, or the blurb would say "crispy," rather than "chewy."  I happen to like raw cookie dough; however, I don't see where these taste like raw cookie dough.  Both are soft, however, so is this the confusion?  And, yes, they stick together.  Soft cookies tend to do that.  They aren't individually wrapped, which would add to the cost.  Oh yeah, chocolate chip cookies tend to be somewhat sweet.So, if you want something hard and crisp, I suggest Nabiso's Ginger Snaps.  If you want a cookie that's soft, chewy and tastes like a combination of chocolate and oatmeal, give these a try.  I'm here to place my second order.
